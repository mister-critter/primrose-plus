# Microblog - Primrose PLUS

My fork of the [Primrose](https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-primrose) theme for Micro.Blog by Garth Braithwaite and Tim Smith.

A few of my changes:

- Reduced number of posts on the home screen to 5 (this helps with load times as well, since my blog is slightly image-heavy)
- Added and styled pagination at the bottom of the home page
- Made various layout and responsive fixes to the Home, about, Photos, and Archive pages
- Styled category links on the Archive page and normal links within posts
- Rounded my avatar photo
- Probably some other minor things I forgot

## Changes In Progress:

- Dark mode toggle

## Wishlist:
 - YouTube/Vimeo video embed support
 - Number of comments beside date of each post on the homepage
 - Disqus comments under each post
